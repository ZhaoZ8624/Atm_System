This program was created to try and imitate an ATM Sytem.
You can operate this system by entering numbers 1-6, with their own respective purposes.
1 is to generate a pin for the user, where it only accepts 4 digit numbers.
2 is to change the pin for the user, where it verifies that the pin given by the user matches the pin in the system, and it only allows the pin to be changed to a 4 digit number.
3 first verifies the user, then checks the balance of the user.
4 first verifies the user, then inquires about the amount to withdraw from the account, where it only allows withdrawals of multiples of 100 and it must be within range of the account's balance.
5 first verifies the user, then inquires about the amount to deposit into the accountm where it only allows deposits of multiples of 100 and it must be a number greater than 0.
6 ends the program.
